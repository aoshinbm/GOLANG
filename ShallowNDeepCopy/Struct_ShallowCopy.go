Shallow copy in go is an assignment.
Everything in go is passed by value so assigning variable
with a struct to another variable makes a copy of that struct.
The same thing goes if you pass a variable to a function.
Method always gets a copy of your variable
(if you pass in a pointer, it gets copy of the pointer! â€”
	but not copy of the value underneath the pointer).
